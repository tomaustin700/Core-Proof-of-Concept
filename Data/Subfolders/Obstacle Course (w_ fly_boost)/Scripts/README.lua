--[[
				Speed ability pickup made by Specific Ocean used for XTREME LASER TAG [Coming Feb 2021]
				
				
				To change the speed: Go into TrigOverlap, and find where it say maxWalkSpeed = 1040, and change 1040 to whatever you want.
				
				To change base 640 speed: Go into TrigOverlap, and find where it say maxWalkSpeed = 640, and change 640 to whatever you want.
				
				To change the cooldown: Go into TrigOverlap, find where it says task.wait(10) and lower that for the amount of time 
				you have enhanced speed. Or change the one that says task.wait(5) to change how long until the ability appears again after
				its finished.
				
				To turn off VFX's: You can delete the bob effect script, or you can go into it and delete where it says vfx1:play() [it says
				it twice] and you can just delete the embers from the heirarchy.
